<b>CATAPULT</b>

How to play:

- Look around at the islands, if a large orange star appears, it's an island you can propel yourself to!

- Use the primary index trigger on the right controller to propel yourself at an angle (between 30 and 70) to the island (fly where most of the stars are!)

- Once you go through each level, a balloon will appear next to the top level, click on it to finish the game!
