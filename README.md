A virtual reality game compatible with the Oculus Rift that allows you to launch yourself from island to island collecting stars!

<b>How to play:</b>

- Look around at the islands. If a large orange star appears above it, it's an island you can catapult yourself to! You cannot catapult to an island without a star on it. Those stars are not collectable and are just there to indicate that the island is selected.

- Start the launch process by holding down the primary index trigger on the right controller. You will see a number at the corner of your screen. This is the angle that you will catapult yourself at and will affect your trajectory. It ranges from 35 to 70 degrees and changes based on how long you hold the trigger. The catapult will start when you release the trigger and will be shot at the angle displayed when you let go. Having a too low or too high angle will cause you to undershoot or overshoot so choose your angle carefully!

- There are times that you may end up too far from the islands or in an uncomfortable position where you can't jump to islands. Press X on the left hand controller to reset your position. 

- There are yellow, collectable stars surrounding each island. Try to collect as many as possible! They will disappear when you collect them. 

- You win by entering the hot air balloon to the next (hypothetical) level. The balloon will only appear once you have visited all 6 islands. Once it appears, you can only enter it from the island nearest it, in this case the highest island. Once on the highest island, look at the balloon and select it by pressing the trigger. 


<b>Pro tips:</b> For an optimal experience

. The closer the island is, the greater the angle needed to reach it.
. Do not be alarmed if you start sliding towards of edge of the island; it's part of the design (or is it?)
. If you can't see any of the islands, try opening your eyes. This will improve your gameplay experience.
. The highest island is actually the easiest to reach from off the side from the main plane with the largest possible angle.
. For a truly immersive experience, get a friend or coworker to fan you while you are catapulting. This will truly replicate the experience of being hurtled through the air. An electric fan is a good substitute. 
. Just for fun - we have hidden 5 (somewhat small) elephants in the scene. They don't give you extra points but if you can find them all, then you are the true pro.
